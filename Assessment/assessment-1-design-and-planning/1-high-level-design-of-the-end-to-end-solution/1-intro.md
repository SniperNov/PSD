The client would like a system for the analysis of academic papers and other sources (e.g.,
news articles). The analysis options would encompass (but not be limited to):

- Authorship
- Sentiment
- Theme
- Topic

The solution should allow researchers and/or analysts to ingest academic and other source
articles into a data store for running analysis queries targeting the information and metadata
collated about the papers. Some examples of analysis queries could include (but not be limited to):
-  Clusters of papers around topics
-  Links between authors
-  Links between topics
-  Links between authors and topics
-  Sentiment analysis
-  Paper outcomes
-  Retractions
-  Paper reference networks
-  Timeline

> Please note the analysis is expected to include identifying how papers and/or articles are
linked beyond just identifying common authors or referencing.

The solution should provide a method to enable different visualisations of the results, from
textual to graphical, supporting interactive analysis and near-real-time query processing on
the data store.
The solution components should support (but not limited to):
- Data ingest from different sources.
- Data storing in raw and analytics-ready form.
- Query layer.
- Visualisation system supporting multiple visualisation types.

Components which could be introduced to support additional analysis could be (but not limited to):
- Additional processing pipeline for the identification of common technologies introduced or employed.
- Additional processing pipeline for the identification of common models used across a field.
- Functionality allowing individual analysts to add curated metadata or data about papers in the data store for themselves and others to use.
