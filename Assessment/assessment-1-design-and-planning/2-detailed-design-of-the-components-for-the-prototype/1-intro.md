# Intro

As a prototype we are going to develop a simple abstract query language that would be able to 
query a given datasource, but is not limited to and would be able to visualise the 
data in a format that would be suitable for the end user.

For simplicity, UI interface would be provided as a **console terminal application**. As a result 
the team will focus on the technical part of the app and do not spend much time on
developing a more complex UI application. 

As it can be challenging to provide a proper visual experience in terminal application we will
try to figure out the best and the simplest way for user to get query results. Some simple 
solution can be made directly inside the terminal. However, for difficult queries we can
approach this in a format of external link to an image, saved on some shared data storage. 

During the application development we are going to introduce only one or two queries. We plan to
provide only one or two visual results. However, the program would be developed in the way that 
assumes an ability to easily extend its functionality, in order to support additional queries 
and visualisation modules.

It is important to mention, that this program is going to be developed with the idea, that we
are not limited to only one database. One query can be executed to gather results from 
**various data storagies** in the same time. 

The resulting POC can be easily integrated into the end-to-end solution mentioned in the first 
part of the report.
