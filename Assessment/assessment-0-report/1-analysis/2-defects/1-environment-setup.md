when installing packages. It usually takes a long time to set up the environment before running the code.
In addition, the environment listed in requirements.txt is not always useful. Some packages from the 
`requirements.txt` file are never used in the code. No information about the exact python3 and pip versions used. 
There is no information about environment dependencies and libraries that has to be installed before the main code.
