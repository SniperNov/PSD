## Performance improvement thought

As long as we are not very good at understanding all the algorithms behind the program to improve the speed 
of low level processes we can try to do 2 things: 

1. Reduce the amount of disk operations.
2. Improve the program to use more threads or use message passing interface. 

We suppose this will add significant improvements in program speed. 
Further improvement should be done after the steps mentioned above.
