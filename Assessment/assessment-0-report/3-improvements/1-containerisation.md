## Docker 
The process of installing and running the program can be different on different OS, environments, 
and machines. To make it cleaner and more predictable it is a good practice to  have a docker container that would 
encapsulate these things. Some benefits that this approach can give us:

- Simplified installation instruction.
- Constant behavior between any OS, machines, and environments.
- Input and Output incapsulation.
- Easy to scale. 
- No need to worry about configuration anymore as we can use volumes to override files on different environments.
